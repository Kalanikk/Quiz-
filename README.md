1. Project overview
This project is a single-page quiz application that shows one question at a time, accepts a user answer, gives immediate feedback, keeps score, and shows a final result. It’s ideal for practice projects, tutorials, or embedding in small websites.

2. Features
Multiple-choice questions (single correct answer)

Immediate correct / incorrect feedback

Score tracking and final result screen

Simple, responsive UI (works on mobile and desktop)

Easy to extend — questions stored in a JavaScript array

3. Files / structure
bash
Copy
Edit
simple-quiz/
│
├─ index.html         # Main HTML page
├─ styles.css         # Styling for the quiz
└─ script.js          # Quiz logic (questions, scoring, UI)
4. How to run
Download or clone the simple-quiz folder.

Open index.html in any modern web browser (no server required).

Play!

5. How to add or edit questions
Questions are stored as an array in script.js. Example format:

js
Copy
Edit
const questions = [
  {
    question: "What is the capital of France?",
    choices: ["Paris", "Berlin", "Madrid", "Rome"],
    correctIndex: 0
  },
  {
    question: "Which language runs in a web browser?",
    choices: ["Python", "C#", "JavaScript", "Java"],
    correctIndex: 2
  }
];
question — text shown to the user

choices — array of answer options

correctIndex — index (0-based) of the correct choice

Add, remove, or edit objects in the array to change the quiz.

6. Customization tips
Change styling in styles.css to match your brand or theme.

Add a timer per question by adding a countdown in script.js.

Add multiple correct answers by replacing correctIndex with an array of correct indexes and updating the answer-checking logic.

Store high scores in localStorage to persist between sessions.

Add categories by grouping question arrays and letting the user pick a category before starting.

7. Keyboard controls (optional)
Implementing keyboard support improves accessibility. Suggested bindings:

Number keys 1–4 — choose option 1–4

Enter — submit current selection (if implementing selection-first flow)

N or → — next question

R — restart quiz

(Keyboard support is easy to add with document.addEventListener('keydown', ...) in script.js.)

Example mini-checklist before publishing
